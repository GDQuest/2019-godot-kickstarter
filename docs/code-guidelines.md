# Coding Guidelines

This document describes GDScript coding style and best practices to organize code base to keep sane when developing mid-to-large projects.

The ideas exposed below take inspiration from good practices from different paradigms and languages, especially from Python and functional programming, as well as the official GDScript documentation.

There isnâ€™t a straightforward way of transposing these ideas into an object-oriented setting such as when working with Godot since it has its way of handling interactions.

To create modular and composable systems, we have to manage boundaries: the places where different game systems interact with one another. Especially the interaction of the game systems with the user.

## Code Writing Style

This section shows our programming style by example.

<!-- TODO: Add a short but complete, real-world example -->
Start with the `extends` keyword if the class extends a built-in type.

Then include `class_name`, but only if necessary. E.g. if you need to check for this type in other classes, or to be able to create the node in the create node dialogue.

Following that you should have the class's docstring:

```gdscript
extends Node
class_name MyNode

"""
A brief description of the class's role and functionality

A longer description, if needed, possibly of multiple paragraphs. Properties
and method names should be in backticks like so: `_process`, `x` etc.

Notes
-----
Specific things that don't fit the class's description above.

Keep lines under 100 characters long
"""
```

Signals go first and don't use parentheses unless they pass function parameters. Use the past tense to name signals. Append `_started` or `_finished` if the signal corresponds to the beginning or the end of an action.

```gdscript
signal moved
signal talk_started(parameter_name)
signal talk_finished
```

Place `onready` variables after signals, because we mostly use them to keep track of child nodes this class accesses. Having them at the top of the file makes it easier to keep track of dependencies.

You should always include an explicit type for them: in some cases, Godot can't infer the type directly, and it gives us limited autocompletion when we use these variables.

```gdscript
onready var timer : Timer = $Timer
onready var ysort : YSort = $YSort
```

After that enums, constants, and exported variables, in this order. The enums' names should be in `CamelCase` while the values themselves should be in `ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE`. The reason for this order is that exported variables might depends on previously defined enums and constants.

```gdscript
enum TileTypes { EMPTY=-1, WALL, DOOR }

const MAX_TRIALS : = 3
const TARGET_POSITION : = Vector2(2, 56)

export(int) var number
```

Follow enums with member variables. Their names should use `snake_case`. Define setters and getters when properties alter their behavior instead of using methods to access them.

```gdscript
var animation_length : = 1.5
var tile_size : = 40
var side_length : = 5 setget set_side_length, get_side_length
```

Define virtual methods from Godot (those starting with a leading `_`, e.g. `_ready`). Always leave 2 blanks lines between methods to visually distinguish methods and other code blocks.

```gdscript
func _init() -> void:
  pass


func _process(delta: float) -> void:
  pass
```

Then define public methods. Include type hints for variables and the return type. We don't use private variables as anyone can decide to use them and they show in the autocomplete list. If you want to hide functionality away from the user, have the node delegate the work to one of its children.

You can use a brief docstring, if need be, to describe what the function does and what it returns. To describe the return value in the docstring, start the sentence with `Returns`. Use the present tense and direct voice. See Godot's [documentation writing guidelines](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/community/contributing/docs_writing_guidelines.html) for more information.

```gdscript
func can_move(cell_coordinates: Vector2) -> bool:
  return grid[cell_coordinates] != TileTypes.WALL
```

For signal callbacks, we use Godot's convention,  `_on_NodeName_signal_name`:

```gdscript
func _on_Quest_started(which : Quest) -> void:
  ...
```

If the object connects to itself though, you should remove `NodeName`:

```gdscript
extends Area2D
class_name HitBox


func _ready() -> void:
  connect("area_entered", self, "_on_area_entered")
```

Use `return` only at the beginning and end of functions. If `return` is at the beginning, you can use it as a defense mechanism in an `if` statement.

**Don't** return in the middle of the method. It makes it harder to track returned values. Here's an example of a **clean** and readable method:

```gdscript
func _set_elements(elements: int) -> bool:
  """
  Sets up the shadow scale, number of visual elements and instantiates as needed.
  Returns true if the operation succeeds, else false
  """
  if not has_node("SkinViewport") or \
     elements > ELEMENTS_MAX or \
     not has_node("Shadow"):
    return false

  # If the check succeeds, proceed with the changes
  var skin_viewport : = $SkinViewport
  var skin_viewport_staticbody : = $SkinViewport/StaticBody2D
  for node in skin_viewport.get_children():
    if node != skin_viewport_staticbbody:
      node.queue_free()

  var interval : = INTERVAL
  var r : = RandomNumberGenerator.new()
  r.randomize()
  for i in range(elements):
    var e : = Element.new()
    e.node_a = "../StaticBody2D"
    e.position = skin_viewport_staticbody.position
    e.position.x += r.randf_range(interval.x, interval.y)
    interval = interval.rotated(PI/2)
    skin_viewport.add_child(e)

  $Shadow.scale = SHADOW.scale * (1.0 + elements/6.0)
  return true
```

### Avoid `null` like the plague

**Use `null` only if you're forced to**. Instead, think about alternatives to implement the same functionality with other types.

`None`, `null`, `NULL`, etc. references could be the biggest mistake in the history of computing. Here's an explanation from the man who invented it himself: [Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare).

For programming languages that rely on `null`, such as GDScript, it's impossible to get rid of it completely: a lot of functionality relies on built-in functions that work with and return `null` values.

`null` can behave like any other value in any context, so the compiler can't find errors caused by `null` at compile time. `null` exceptions are only visible at runtime. This makes it more likely to write code that will fail when someone plays the game and it should be avoided like the plague.

You can use other values to initialize variables of certain types. For example, if a function returns a positive `int` number, if it is not able to calculate the desired return value, the function could return `-1` to suggest there was an error.

### Use static types

We use optional static typing with GDscript.

At the time of writing, static GDScript typing doesn't provide any perofrmance boosts or any other compiler features yet. But it does bring better code completion and better error reporting and warnings, which are good improvements over dynamically typed GDScript. In the future, it should bring performance improvements as well.

Be sure to check [Static typing in GDScript](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/static_typing.html) to get started with this language feature.

Normally, you define typed variables like this:

```gdscript
var x : Vector2 = some_function_returning_Vector2(param1, param2)
```

But if `some_function_returning_Vector2` is also annotated with a return type, Godot can infer the type for us so we only need to add a colon after the variable's name:

```gdscript
func some_function_returning_Vector2(param1: int, param2: int) -> Vector2:
  # do some work
  return Vector2()

var v : = some_function_returning_Vector2(param1, param2) # The type is Vector2
```

_Note_ how we still use the collon in the assignment: `: =`. It isn't just `=`. Without the colon, the variable's type would be dynamic.

Use `: =` with a space between the colon and the equal sign, **not** `:=`. `: =` is easier to spot compared to `=`, in case someone forgets to use the colon.

**Let Godot infer the type whenever you can**. It's less error prone because the system keeps better track of types than we humanly can. It also pushes us to have proper return values for all the functions and methods that we write.

Since the static type system mostly brings better warnings and it isn't enforced, sometimes we have to help it out. The following snippet will make the problem clear:

```gdscript
var arr : = [1, 'test']
var s : String = arr.pop_back()
var i : int = arr.pop_back()
```

The `Array` type is a container for multiple diffrent types. In the example above, we have both an `int` and a `String` stored in the array. If you only wrote `var s : = arr.pop_back()`, Godot would complain because it doesn't know what type the `pop_back` method returns. You will get the same issue with all built-in methods that return the engine's `Variant` type. Open the code reference with <kbd>F4</kbd> and search for the methods to see that:

```
Variant pop_back()
  Remove the last element of the array.
```

`Variant` is a generic type that can hold any type Godot supports. That's why we have to explicitly write variable types when dealing with these functions: `var s : String = arr.pop_back()`.

In these cases, you must be careful as the following is also valid:

```gdscript
var arr : = [1, 'test']
var s : int = arr.pop_back()
var i : String = arr.pop_back()
```

You will not get any error with this code. At runtime, `s` will surprinsingly still contain a `String`, and `i` will contain an `int`. But a type check like `s is String` or `i is int` will return `false`. That's a weakness of the current type system that we should keep in mind.

### Write self-documenting code and use comments sparingly

If you need comments to explain most of what your code does, you can most likely rewrite it to make it more transparent for everyone. When working together or other an extended period, code readability is essential for everyone to stay productive.

Use clear variable names in plain English, and write full words. E.g. `character_position` and not `char_pos`. Same for method names.

**Do not** repeat the same word in the method's name and its arguments. E.g. write `Inventory.add(item)`, not `Inventory.add_item(item)`. The same goes for signals. Don't repeat the class's name in signals, use plain verbs instead:

```gdscript
Extends Node
class_name Event

signal started
signal completed
```

You *may* use short variable names inside of your methods, for local variables, to avoid repeating a type hint for instance. In the example below, the variable `e`, an instance of `Element`, only appears in 4 consecutive lines, so the code stays readable:

```gdscript
func _set_elements(elements: int) -> bool:
...
  for i in range(elements):
    var e : = Element.new()
    e.node_a = "../StaticBody2D"
    e.position = skin_viewport_staticbody.position
...
```

#### Use comments if they save time or add key explanations

Your code should be **self-explanatory whenever possible**. But sometimes it's not: you may have a long block of code that you can't change, or have some strange code to work around an engine bug. In these cases, writing a short comment above the corresponding block can save everyone a lot of time, including your future self.

In this example, the code involves transforming and multiplying matrices to calculate some position in Godot's 2d viewport. A one-line comment can capture what it does and avoid having to make sense of the calculations:

```gdscript
func drag_to(event_position: Vector2) -> void:
  # Calculate the position of the mouse cursor relative to the RectExtents' center
  var viewport_transform_inverse := rect_extents.get_viewport().get_global_canvas_transform().affine_inverse()
  var viewport_position: Vector2 = viewport_transform_inv.xform(event_position)
  var transform_inverse := rect_extents.get_global_transform().affine_inverse()
  var target_position : Vector2 = transform_inv.xform(viewport_position.round())
```

Here's a comment that explains why a seemingly strange line of code is necessary so another developer doesn't remove it inadvertently, thinking it's a mistake:

```gdscript
extends BattlerAI

func choose_action(actor : Battler, targets : Array = []):
    # We use yield even though the  an action is instantaneous
    # because the combat system expects this method to use a coroutine
    yield(get_tree(), "idle_frame")
    ...
```


## System Design and Interactions

In this section we're going to discuss how can we create decoupled and reusable game systems in Godot.

One of the most difficult jobs of a developer is to design and to manage different systems interacting with one another. This is especially true in the game development world where we push the hardware to the limit, making use of parallelism & concurency, async, and every tool in the box.

*Dynamic Imperative Object-Oriented* programming languages like GDScript are fast to prototype ideas with, but with this freedom there comes a cost. It's easy to create tightly coupled code or fragile code, code that will break. That is to say systems that are hard to debug.

We need some high-level guidelines to avoid producing coupled code. We can test decoupled systems independently. Decoupled systems don't care where they receive data from. They are black boxes that are fed data and produce some output, be it visual or returned values. They don't know anything about the world outside of themselves. This makes them independent and reusable across game projects.

### Every node and scene should run on its own

**If we choose to save branch as a scene, we should be able to run it on its own without any errors**. And that at each level in the scene tree.

Godot's main functionality relies on its node tree, a recursive data structure: if we pick any node in the tree, this node, together with all its children, is a complete tree in itself. You can see and think about it as an independent scene.

![](./imgs/scene_tree.png)

In the example above, you can view each node as a separate scene, be it `Board` or `QuestSystem`.

If we save `QuestSystem` using `Save Branch as Scene`, we should be able to run this scene locally, with <kbd>F6</kbd>, without any error. In this case we can't expect to have the same behavior as when we play the main `Game` scene, as it could depend on other data to show all its potential, but it should still run without any errors.

![](./imgs/orpg_quest_system.gif)

In general, if we try to run any of the nodes at any depth level as an independent scene we should be able to do it without any errors.

To do so you should never have direct references to specific objects from another system. Instead, you should rely on a parent node to route information and let the system connect to others via signals.

In the example above, the `Game` node has a script attached to it. This script sends some information from one system to another, while e.g. `QuestSystem` or `DialogSystem` have no idea that other systems exist outside themselves.

<!-- TODO: cover a real-world example, e.g. in video? -->

### Use signals to coordinate time-dependent interactions

Godot's signals are the [Observer pattern](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/observer.html), a very useful tool that allows one node to react to a change in another, without storing it or having a direct reference to it.

Godot comes with many systems like physics, rendering, or input that run in parallel threads to squeeze every bit of hardware resource available. Oftentimes direct function calls aren't the right way to intract with objects.

Also, we can't always predict when an event will occur. Say we have an animation with a random or a varying duration. Sometimes it ends after 1 second, sometimes after 1.2 seconds. Signals allow us to react to the animation right when it finishes, regardless of its duration.

In practice, it can be difficult to know exactly when to use direct function calls and when to use signals. But with time and practice, managing information gets easier.

So **rely on signals when orchestrating time-dependent interactions.**
